# PHP Shortags Converter #

A simple script to convert all the shortag PHP scripts in a folder (and its subfolders)
to full tag representation.


## Usage ##

1. Copy stc.php to your project's root folder
2. Open up a console and navigate to your root folder
3. run "php -d short_open_tag=On stc.php"

After this all your project files should be converted to full tag representation.
The output of the script will show you what files it converted.


## Why? ##

Could not find a simple script for this purpose that I can just copy+paste and run.
All the references found quickly suggested to do this by hand as this is pretty easy
task.

But hey, I'd like to save my 10 mins a day!
